# React App for Bus Tracking

It uses data provided by http://webservices.nextbus.com/ to show predicted arrival timings for selected agency and stop. Nextbus supports many public bus agencis around the world

This was my first try at using awesome ReactJS to build something and I really enjoyed it.

# Development

The fundamental functionality of app is working now but I still have more ideas and optimizations to make. Stay tuned!
